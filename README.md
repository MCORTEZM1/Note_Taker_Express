  ## **Description**
   
  - Note Taker Express will help you and create notes throughout the day. You can add notes, review notes, and delete notes from the page.
  - This application was written using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, ES6, Node
  - Note Taker Express solves the issue of needing a place to store all of your notes in a single location! 
  - While building this application, I expanded on my understanding of express and Heroku servers, as well as merging a front-end application with the back-end
